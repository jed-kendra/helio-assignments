What is a Promise? 
Promises are objects that allow us to use asynchronous code as if they are synchronous code.  They allow us to control the timing of the code by showing the eventual completion or failure of an operation and its resulting value.


How do we use Promises? 
We use promises to control asynchronous code.  In our example, the module parameter we used was asynchronouse, so we used the promise. 


What are the benefits of using Promises? 
It allows us to control asynchronous code.
