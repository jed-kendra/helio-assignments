How do you think XML relates to HTML?
It is similiar to HTML, but you can use your own tags.

What are some benefits of something like HTML using XML's syntax? 
The tags will be better descriptors.

What are some disadvantages? 
It will not be as uniform as HTML.  HTML has universal tags so others can read it easily.  Using your own tags may be confusing for others and it also may make it harder to find certain parts of the code when you want to work on it.
